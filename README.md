👼Our Father, which art in heaven,👼
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come;
thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread;
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive them who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.
For thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory, for ever.
Amen 🙏
